"if block need to be enclosed with a pair of curly braces.

An exception is when you have an \\"if\\" followed by \\"else if\\", in this case
\\"else if\\" block does not need to be surrounded by curly braces.

if (someCondition) {
  // ...
} else /* notice missing { here */ if (someCondition) {
  // ...
} else {
  // ...
}

Rationale:
Readability in dense packed code.
In the snippet below, for instance, with poor indentation it is easy to
mistaken hello() and world() to belong to the same branch of logic.

if (someCondition) {
  2;
} else
  hello();
world();"
